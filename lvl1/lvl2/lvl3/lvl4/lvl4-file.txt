Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane!

What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. You can act like a man!

My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name? In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.
